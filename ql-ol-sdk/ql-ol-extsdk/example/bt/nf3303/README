1. Please Through the adb or other ways to push below files to the correct directory.Here is an example
    adb push ./lib/firmware/BCM4339_003.001.009.0119.0000.hcd /etc/bluetooth/
    adb push ./lib/firmware/bluegate_hw.conf /etc/bluetooth/
    adb push ./lib/firmware/bt_stack.conf /etc/bluetooth/
    adb push ./lib/libbluegate.so /lib/
NOTE:Please see the file "bluegate_hw.conf" to ensure that the configured serial port is consistent with the actual hardware and software

2. Configure Hardware to Run BLE Demo
   a)Turn on the power supply of BT module.Here is an example
       echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/regulator/rome_vreg/enable
   b)reset BT module by operate BT_EN Pin.Here is an example
       echo 1019 > /sys/class/gpio/export
       echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio1019/direction
       echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio1019/value
       sleep 3
       echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio1019/value
    c)Initialize BT_DEV_WAKE pins.This is more complicated. Please refer to the code.
    d)Initialize BT_DEV_WAKE pins.This is more complicated. Please refer to the code.

3. Compile code
    cd ql-ol-sdk/
    source ql-ol-crosstool/ql-ol-crosstool-env-init
    cd ql-ol-extsdk/example/bt/nf3303/
    make clean
    make

    You will see the final executable file named example_nf3303_ble_server

4. Running Demo
   adb push ../../example_nf3303_ble_server /usrdata/
   ./example_nf3303_ble_server

5. Turn on Phone Bluetooth. If it's an iphone, download an APP called LightBlue. If it's an android phone, please download an APP called BLE Deng.
   Please refer to the APP for guidance scanning bluetooth module. You will see a BLE device named Quectel NF3303.
